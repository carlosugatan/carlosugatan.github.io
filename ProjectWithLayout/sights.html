<h1>Sights in Guam</h1>
<p>Historical sights and landmarks are spread across Guam. From Latte Stones huts, forts, and monuments: visiting each site may take you half the day! It's always a great idea to schedule an "Around The Island" tour in your travel plan! Don't worry, this will only take a day! Starting from the North and ending the day in the South to enjoy the sunset. Nothing sounds better than that.</p>
